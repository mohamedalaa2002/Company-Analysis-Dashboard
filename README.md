# Company-Analysis-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project in Power Bi, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data.This process involved several stages,including data preprocessing,data cleaning and data visualization.

my latest Power BI dashboard, analyzing the sales performance of a global bicycle company. This project goes beyond just visualizing data—it aims to uncover growth opportunities and operational challenges.

Summary:

1-​Growth Surge: January 2014 saw a massive leap in volume, reaching 861K units sold (up from 265K in 2013), driving total sales to $119M.📈
2-​Profitability: While revenue is high, total profit stands at $17M (approx. 14% margin), signaling a need to optimize production costs.
3-​Product Leadership: "Paseo" remains the market favorite, contributing a solid $36M to gross sales.
4-​Market Concentration: The Government segment is the primary revenue driver at $52.5M, highlighting a strong B2G (Business-to-Government) presence.


​Strategic Recommendations & Insights:

1-​Margin Optimization: Given the 14% profit margin, there is a significant opportunity to review the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), especially for high-volume products like Paseo.
2-​Diversification: To mitigate risk, the company should focus on expanding the Enterprise and Small Business segments to reduce heavy reliance on government contracts.
3-​Midmarket Potential: The Midmarket segment is currently underperforming ($2.38M). Exploring "entry-level" models or targeted marketing could unlock new revenue streams in this category.


​Technical Toolkit:

1-​Data Transformation: Cleaning and structuring YoY datasets.
2-​Advanced Visualization: Designing intuitive layouts for quick executive decision-making.
3-​Strategic Analysis: Translating raw KPIs into actionable business advice.
